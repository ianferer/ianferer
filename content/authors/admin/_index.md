My name is Ian Ferer. I graduated from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 2019 with a B.S. in Mathematics and a concentration in Operations Research. In my spare time, I enjoy exploring projects involving the use of statistics in sports, specifically in ice hockey. Most of my interest in data analysis in hockey is with respect to game management and optimizing coaching decisions, although I am working on a few other projects related more closely to player evaluation and other facets of the game itself.
